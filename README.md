# Snake-Game
After gaining knowledge about Object Oriented Programming as well as the turtle module. Now building the famous snake game this is 

probably one of the most famous mobile games that ever was, and it's definitely one of my favorite. A snake game that has,a moving snake, 

which you control using your keyboard,and you can go and get food, and then it grows in length as it eats more food.And you have to make 

sure that you don't end up getting tangled or hitting the wall. And the goal is to eat as much food as you can while staying alive.

It will keep record of high score in a separate file So if a user gets a score that's higher than the previous high score, then if they game over, 

then the high score is going to be updated. This will be done by using skills of manipulating file systems, reading and writing to file.
